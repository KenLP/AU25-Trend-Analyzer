    "summary": "In São Paulo, Brazil’s largest city, modeling underground infrastructure involves complex technical and data challenges. This case study will present the first Brazilian project to apply SCAN-2-BIM with IFC 4.3 interoperability in an active metro tunnel—part of the Line 2-Green extension, more than 40 meters deep. Reality capture was done entirely with terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). The point cloud was semantically classified and feature-extracted in ReCap software. Modeling was automated using Civil 3D software with Dynamo and Subassembly Composer, while coordination and export were handled via Navisworks and IFC 4.3 from Civil 3D. The team overcame issues of data volume, accuracy, and integration. This pioneering project also defined asset-agnostic workflows for SCAN-2-BIM in linear infrastructure—scalable and reusable across future projects.",

In this session, you’ll discover a smart, automated approach to MEP coordination using Dynamo and rule-based artificial intelligence (AI) logic. Simply enter the available floor-to-slab height, and the system allocates dedicated zones for HVAC, plumbing, and electrical services. Once zones are defined, services are automatically repositioned into their assigned spaces. After this, the system intelligently flags potential clash zones where conflicts might still arise—even before you run clash detection. Based on real workflows used in one of Saudi Arabia’s largest commercial projects, this session will deliver a game-changing method to reduce rework, speed up coordination, and achieve next-level automation in Revit software.",

    "summary": "This session will outline a workflow for creating a Revit model of a steel composite cable stay bridge by using a combo of Grasshopper, Dynamo, and Informed Design for Inventor software. Modeling a bridge structure poses challenges due to its complex geometry, which adheres to a vertical, horizontal, and super-elevated roadway profile. Consequently, the steel girders, beams, and connection details must align with this 3D roadway profile, complicating the creation and placement of Revit families. For this challenge, COWI used Grasshopper and Dynamo to automate the creation of steel geometry, parameters, and insertion points, ensuring accurate orientation for family placement. Additionally, Informed Design was used to transform various iterations of intricate steel connections into families, which were then positioned using a Dynamo workflow. The integration of visual programming and Informed Design has been vital in efficiently producing complex bridge structures with a focus on automation.",

    "summary": "<p>Buildings contribute to more than 40% of global carbon emissions, and one key scalable solution is to reuse and upgrade existing buildings and materials instead of constructing new ones. This session showcases how Autodesk Research is exploring artificial intelligence (AI) for net-zero buildings in the context of existing building projects. The team is exploring two AI-driven prototypes: one is about assessing a building’s existing conditions with limited and multimodal data. This enables AECO professionals to \"see inside walls\"—similarly to an “x-ray view”—and cataloging hidden materials including their potential for reusability without destructive testing. The second AI-driven prototype involves creating new low-carbon assemblies using repurposed materials. With this workflow users can specify high-level goals like “reuse materials”, “reduce carbon” and “minimize cost” and interactively explore many different options. The presentation highlights potential integration opportunities with relevant Autodesk platform features, demonstrating how designers, contractors, and building owners can make informed decisions that significantly minimize carbon footprint while creating new economic value from existing assets.</p>\n",

Although Japan rail owners are adopting BIM, efforts remain siloed across teams and lack integrated optimization. Rail maintenance requires ongoing inspection, diagnosis, action, and documentation. Seamless data handover is essential to reducing lifecycle costs, but information often stays locked in noninteroperable systems. JR Central addressed this by piloting a common data environment and object library for embankments, following ISO 19650-based information management. Interoperability was ensured through openBIM standards such as Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and bSDD (buildingSMART Data Dictionary), which unify object definitions and data formats. Revit and Construction Cloud, powerful BIM tools, were also adopted to enhance authoring consistency and collaborative workflows. This initiative unlocks a new era in infrastructure maintenance—firmly grounded in interoperability.",

Impeding challenges—aging highways and labor shortages in the construction industry—make the improvement on productivity at construction sites a high priority. In an attempt to tackle down the challenges, we started considering using BIM from 2017 to shift from analog data-centered to digitized-data-centered construction management. In 2020, we’d established standards necessary for BIM use and set a policy to embrace intelligent models in design and construction phases, ICT construction, and a common data environment (CDE). Based on this policy, BIM was finally applied to the design and construction phase from July 2025. In addition, we adopted Construction Cloud to realize a CDE to streamline the legacy means of communication between multiple project stakeholders. In this session, you will gain insights and tips on how to realize an owner-led CDE.",

At Autodesk University 2025, we are proud to showcase a powerful new vision for facility management: a Digital Workplace platform that seamlessly connects design, operation, and intelligence.\nWe believe the future of facility management hinges on “high-quality data”—data that is not only precise but constantly updated, easily accessible, and contextually rich. To deliver this, we go beyond just creating Digital Workplaces—we create “connected ecosystems”.\nAt the heart of our approach is the “fusion of three powerful platforms”:\n* Tandem – for BIM-based Digital Workplace modeling and lifecycle data management\n* Eptura – for proven excellence in asset and workplace management\n* Shimizu Corporation's Facility Data Hub – our proprietary platform that brings deep field experience and operational insight into the digital layer\nTogether, we build and maintain a “next-generation Digital Workplace” that integrates building design (BIM), workplace operations, and asset performance into a single source of truth. We call this: “Tandem + Eptura with BIM Integration”.\nThis is not just a concept—it’s a working solution. We are proud to be validating this integrated platform in our own headquarters building in Tokyo. Here, we bring theory into practice, using real-time data, real-world assets, and actual operations to demonstrate how a unified Digital Workplace can drive smarter decisions, better maintenance, and more sustainable facility operations.\nOur commitment to “data quality” is unwavering—because AI-driven insights are only as good as the data that feeds them. And in tomorrow’s world, where automation and intelligence will define success, we believe that Digital Workplaces must be both “technically robust and operationally meaningful”.\n\nCome visit our exhibit and experience:\n* How Tandem structures and visualizes BIM data across the building lifecycle\n* How Eptura enhances asset intelligence and workplace efficiency\n* How Shimizu’s Facility Data Hub ensures continuity between construction, occupancy, and operation\n* And how all of these come together to form an AI-ready Digital Workplace—designed not just for today, but for the evolving challenges of tomorrow\nThis is more than software. It’s a strategic collaboration. It’s a commitment to smarter, connected, sustainable buildings.\n\n”Experience the future. Experience the twin.”",

    "summary": "The Terminal 2 Baggage Programme (T2BP) at Heathrow aims to replace the aging T2 baggage system linked to Terminal 1. The new solution will be implemented in five phases across 21 construction projects, grouped by physical and operational attributes. A major challenge was managing design risks through different organizations and suppliers that interface at key areas in a live operational environment. The manual Excel processes used to record design risks led to difficulties in maintaining a single source of truth, causing duplication and errors. The goal was to find a streamlined, digital solution to standardize processes and enable monitoring and reporting through dashboards. After researching data environments, Construction Cloud was chosen for its suitability to manage design risk information, requiring customization through trial and feedback. The solution also provided integration with augmented reality (AR) for live inspections.",

    "summary": "Our clients’ specifications are more and more demanding, as governments ask for architecture, engineering, and construction industries to improve their carbon footprints and reduce energy consumption. In France, we need to reach “Carbon Neutrality” by 2050, and this can only be done if major construction companies like VINCI Construction decide to use powerful tools to optimize their projects. Using web applications like Time To Beem, we’ve managed to successfully reach our French clients’ specifications. We’ve also achieved a 50% time savings on our sustainable development engineering. These platforms allow us to upload an intelligent model and quickly assign a carbon footprint to all objects. By extracting quantities and the carbon footprint, we can then have the effect of each discipline and precisely decide on how to make more efforts. Theoretically, we should be able to build a very large database to train artificial intelligence (AI) models and create better and better designs!",

We’ve been using Revit intelligent modeling since 2011, and have identified it as the most precise tool for integrated planning across all phases of a construction project. Decisive planning from the start leads to intelligent models with high-level content, even at an early stage. What kind of Information should flow from a project manager to the design team? Which parameters need to be specified as early as possible, so that the data can later be used for cost management, tendering, and construction—as well as for lifecycle analysis? Preparing a solid planning foundation at the beginning of a project using BIM leads to an efficient and clearly structured project flow, eliminating the need for duplicate work processes, and ensuring a smooth path through all project phases.

Our GraphQL APIs enable customers to work across the many data sources for their projects—whether buildings for construction, manufactured components, or assets in a media production. And there should be a common solution for data access when working with the rich, granular data stored in these Autodesk Data Models and Data Exchanges. This presentation will be a case study of how GraphQL was used to build data connectors between Autodesk’s platform and third-party applications. Our engineering team collaborated with System Integrators to produce several connectors—for Microsoft’s Power BI and Power Automate, and Autodesk Dynamo. Each connector shared common and unique integration challenges. We’d like to share our journey of discovery that resulted in customer utility and reveal how we brought the Autodesk Data Models to life through successful integration use cases.",

    "summary": "Manufacturing companies often face challenges when transforming key product information, particularly the bills of materials (BOMs). Starting with a CAD BOM, an initial engineering BOM is created and shared with downstream processes. This BOM undergoes several transformations: first to a manufacturing BOM, then to a process BOM, and finally to a service BOM. Managing these BOMs and their transformations within a single PLM environment can significantly reduce errors, delays, and inconsistencies. PLM streamlines the entire process, enhancing efficiency and enabling automation. Join us to discover how a unified PLM system can seamlessly manage BOM transformations, ensuring accurate and timely updates across all stages. Understand how this integration supports better decision making and drives success in manufacturing operations. ",

A parametric adaptive ring family, developed in collaboration with Autodesk, served as the base for a modular tunnel model in Revit. Using Dynamo, both primary and secondary structures were generated, and system layouts were added for space proofing. The model was then integrated into Construction Cloud to support cross-disciplinary collaboration between structure, MEP, and design teams. This connected workflow improved communication, reduced errors, and supported earlier decision-making. Attendees will discover a scalable strategy for managing complexity in linear infrastructure projects and see how parametric design helps create robust, coordinated models ready for execution.",
